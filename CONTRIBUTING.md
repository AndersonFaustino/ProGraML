# Contributing

We ❤️ contributions! This project is built *on*, and *for*, open source. If you
would like to contribute, please read this document.


## Reporting Issues

Report issues and bugs to the GitHub issue tracker for this project. We don't
have requirements for what must go in an issue, I trust your judgment. Please
include as much information as is required for us to reproduce the issue, and
copy and paste the output of:

```sh
$ ./tools/whoami.sh
```

If you find a bug, by far the best way to report it is to write a test which
exposes the issue and submit it as a PR. If you can do this, continue reading.


## Contributing Code

Please see the [Development](/programl/Documentation/Development.md) guide.
To summarize:

1. Always write tests to cover new code.
2. Keep commits small and atomic.
3. Use a code style consistent with the rest of the project.
